# Map 671

## Introductions

### My intro

* outrageGIS mapping: https://www.outragegis.com/

### Syllabus
* Ways to contact me
	* Zoom during office hours
	* Discussion forum
	* email for personal
	* Slack is pimped out messaging service


### Flow and layout of course
* 10 modules 7 with QGIS and 2 with CARTO and Mapbox: http://newmapsplus.github.io/map671/
* Goal of course is
	* To create, manage and process data, e.g., join table attributes, convert formats
	* Do spatial analysis, e.g., point in polygon or intersect
	* Make maps using the unique cartographic capabilities of QGIS and online mapping platforms
* First two modules set up the asset and mapping workflows
* If you are new to Mapping, Cartography, or GIS then spend time on module 2
* The next five modules create state maps of various with bread n butter GIS analysis techniques
* Two modules slippy and interactive maps where can pan, zoom and click on features
* Last module is final project



### New goals in recent semesters
* move to spatial database: PostGIS
	* PostGIS was once difficult to install, but we've seen it become easy enough for most people.
	* optional, but worth it!
	* best platform to manage vector and tabular data and is used in CARTO
	<!-- * SpatiaLite is easier to start but not as robust as PostGIS and Mac users have a problem -->
* Bring in GitHub from module 01 in 672
	* 672 was 10 lessons and no final projects
	* Get exposed to GitHub workflow earlier
	* Start contributing to map portfolio earlier


### Module content and grading...

* Each week spawn/clone lesson repo, make and commit changes, push the changes back to the remote repo, and submit URL to repo in Canvas
* I will clone your lesson repo, make a new branch called, "eval-01", make suggested changes, and issue a pull request to you. You will be able to compare the purposed changes and merge them if you like it.


### Issues with our tools and course materials

* We cover a lot of material! Look at the lesson requirements since most lessons cover more than what needs to be submitted.
* QGIS 3.2 can be used with 2.18 LTR. Differences between versions?
* Working with large file sizes in Github! 50 MB is max. Use .gitignore
