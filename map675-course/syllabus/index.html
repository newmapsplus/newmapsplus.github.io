<p>MAP 675 will enable students to build rich, user-centered web interfaces to promote the exploration and understanding of complex spatial data sets. Students will engage with a variety of open-source and proprietary tools that enhance data pipelines and feed dynamic web maps.</p>
<p>We emphasize building skills that will allow students to more effectively collaborate with other map designers and developers across the web using industry standards and best practices. Course activities and assignments leverage CLI (command line interface) geospatial utilities, vector tile sets and mapping libraries, and ArcGIS to further students&rsquo; abilities to solve a variety of mapping problems.</p>
<h3 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use command-line processes to better understand and manipulate geospatial data in a variety of formats</li>
<li>Integrate industry standards and best practices tools into project management and collaboration with local and remote colleagues</li>
<li>Apply an open-source and proprietary geospatial analyses for data manipulation and conversion within client/server architectures</li>
<li>Develop full-stack mapping solutions</li>
<li>Enhance the performance and aesthetics of web maps using vector data and JS libraries built to support vector tiles</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="format">Format</h3>
<p>This course is an asynchronous online course that requires weekly participation. It spans eight weeks and requires completion of four module assignments, each two weeks long.</p>
<p>The lesson in each module offers a guided tutorial for individuals to learn new tools and processes. You are encouraged to follow and practice the lesson for each week during the first week.</p>
<p>The second part of the lesson contains an example application that expands on the lesson&rsquo;s topic. These examples are explained in some detail and address use cases that are more complex – exposing problems and opportunities that you might face in your projects. You are encouraged to explore the example&rsquo;s code and modify it to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Module assignments, or labs, then follow from the lesson topics, offer limited guidance, and propose structured tasks that integrate conceptual knowledge with practical application to produce well-documented resources for future reference and use.</p>
<p>Like previous courses in the New Maps Plus program, you will access course materials from <a href="https://github.com/newmapsplus">GitHub repositories</a> via each module&rsquo;s Lesson invitation, and submit links to these repositories in Canvas for evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="required-resources">Required resources</h3>

<h3 id="lab--module-topics">Lab &amp; Module Topics</h3>
<h4 id="module-01-traditional-full-stack-mapping">Module 01: Traditional full-stack mapping</h4>
<p>Module 01 introduces the command line interface for data processing and map development in a traditional full-stack environment where we can control the machine that hosts our data (back-end) and what the browser displays when our page first loads (front-end). We&rsquo;ll learn how to use a computer&rsquo;s terminal to log into a back-end remote server to create and manage assets you share with the public. We&rsquo;ll create server-side scripts using GDAL/OGR and PHP to serve GeoJSON from a SQL database to a front-end Leaflet web map.</p>
<h4 id="module-02-self-hosted-vector-tiles">Module 02: Self-hosted vector tiles</h4>
<p>Continuing our full-stack journey, we discover how to create self-hosted vector tiles from GeoJSONs using PMTiles, which we share from our server. We&rsquo;ll then turn to MapLibre GL JS to visualize these vector tiles. Instead of connecting external JavaScript resources, you will learn how to import packages into your code using NPM and bundle and deploy a map project using Vite.</p>
<h4 id="module-03-arcgis-api">Module 03: ArcGIS API</h4>
<p>Module 03 pivots to the ArcGIS ecosystem to explore its collaborative capabilities. We can interface our open-source approach through the many organizations that use the ArcGIS platform. We will focus on using vector tiles hosted on ArcGIS portals and delve into the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and other libraries that consume vector sources and use the Mapbox Style Specification.</p>
<h4 id="module-04-collaborating-through-data-collection">Module 04: Collaborating through data collection</h4>
<p>Our final module focuses on the collaborative aspects of data collection via mobile devices. We will explore the use of ArcGIS Field Maps and Survey123 to collect data in the field and how to visualize that data in a web map. We will discuss how to share and collaborate on these projects with others through ArcGIS Online, GitHub, and our server contig.us.</p>
<h2 id="course--academic-policies">Course &amp; Academic Policies</h2>
<p>This course adheres to the University of Kentucky&rsquo;s academic policies provided in the following link: <a href="https://ombud.uky.edu/students/academic-policies">https://ombud.uky.edu/students/academic-policies</a> Additional policies are detailed in the below sections.</p>
<h4 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>This course does not require in-person nor synchronous online attendance.</p>
<h4 id="teamwork--collaboration">Teamwork &amp; Collaboration</h4>
<p>We are developing a workflow that enables efficient remote collaboration. Consider each week a collaboration with me, the instructor. If you want to explore a specific feature or technique, let me know.</p>
<p>If you collaborate on an assignment with your course colleagues, please observe the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should work through the lesson independently;</li>
<li>Please acknowledge your collaborators in your submission;</li>
<li>Submit your lab assignment to Canvas independently; and</li>
<li>Any textual content that you add to the map or web page, e.g., information about the area shown on the map, should be in your own words or properly cited if you are using someone else&rsquo;s words (see the section on plagiarism).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="collaborative-support-and-respect-for-peers">Collaborative support and respect for peers</h4>
<p>The course, like most within the New Maps Curriculum, encompasses a wide range of skills and knowledge. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that everyone in the class comes with varying degrees of experience, expertise, and priorities, as well as available time for dedicating themselves to the class material. The following guidelines may help you to be a more savvy and effective peer when offering help and support within the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid making assumptions of what other students may know or should know. While the scope of the course is somewhat narrowly defined, mapping and GIS are wide fields with many specific applications.</li>
<li>Avoid excessive use of tech-jargon and references to technologies that fall beyond the scope of the course. Such references may arise in the course of discussing a particular problem, and there is no shortage of additional tools and approaches to mapping and GIS. Recognize, however, that piling on additional potential solutions may not be useful and can overwhelm newbies struggling to get a grip on a basic, simple solution.</li>
<li>Avoid saying tasks are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; Anything is easy when you&rsquo;ve already overcome the learning curve or have experience doing it. Again, be cognizant that for someone who is struggling to learn or master a particular skill set, being told that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;easy&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t helpful.</li>
<li>Be aware of the gendered nature of technology and science. These fields have a long history of exclusion emanating from their origin in the military and subsequently engineering fields, which have predominately been represented by men. Our goal is to invite and include as many people into our practice as we can. This includes recognition that people from diverse backgrounds, ethnic groups, nationalities, religions, and sexual orientations have much to gain and much to give to strengthen our collaborative education.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="statement-on-generative-ai">Statement on Generative AI</h4>
<p>GenAI tools such as ChatGPT may be used in this course for the purposes of testing, optimizing, and debugging code. It can be particularly helpful in exploring solutions in the variety of languages and frameworks used in this course. However, these outputs should be considering starting points for further development and not as final products.</p>
<p>Before submitting any assignment that was aided in any way by GenAI, make sure you understand how the GenAI solution works and have modified it appropriately for your project. If your submitted code is found to be a direct copy (or a lackluster implementation) of a GenAI solution, you will be asked to resubmit your assignment and explain your code to the instrutor.</p>
<p>By keeping track of your AI use and sharing your experiences, we all gain understanding, identify potential issues in this rapidly changing field, and discover better ways to use the resources for our objectives. If you have any questions or
concerns about this policy, contact your instructor before submitting any assignments.</p>
<h4 id="submission-of-assignments">Submission of Assignments</h4>
<p>Students will be assigned biweekly lessons, as found in the Canvas Modules section of this course. All work listed in these lessons must be submitted through Canvas by no later than 11:59 pm EDT on the day they are due (typically, the second Sunday following the module&rsquo;s opening). Precise submission dates for each assignment can found in the Canvas Assignment section.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>Late assignments will be accepted. If you do not have an excused absence and you submit a late assignment, 10% will automatically will be deducted. Students with excused absences approved by the instructor will not be penalized. Late assignments submitted without an excused absence may not receive submission comments with the evaluation.</p>
<h4 id="excused-absences">Excused Absences</h4>
<p>Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant illness;</li>
<li>death of a family member;</li>
<li>trips for members of student organizations sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and trips * for participation in intercollegiate athletic events;</li>
<li>major religious holidays;</li>
<li>interviews for graduate/professional school or full-time employment post-graduation; and</li>
<li>other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for non-attendance” by the instructor of record. Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these policies, this course recognizes that a documented network or platform outage, e.g., Canvas not working, justifies an excused absence. Technical problems and scheduling conflicts also arise from time-to-time, and we recognize that assignments need to be turned in late. Please notify me as soon as possible if you anticipate a late assignment to discuss a “reasonable cause for non-attendance” that justifies an excused absence.</p>
<h4 id="class-behavior-and-civility">Class Behavior and Civility</h4>
<p>All participants in this course should maintain the highest standards of academic, professional, and personal integrity and support a safe and inclusive learning environment (see the section on non-discrimination). With an understanding of mutual respect and civil discourse, we cultivate an online environment free from:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional harm, hostility, and excessive persuasion;</li>
<li>disturbances that interfere with course instruction and learning;</li>
<li>content that degrades an individual or group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to stop and remove content (Zoom meetings, discussion posts, etc.) that conflicts with the above statement.</p>
<h4 id="chosen-names-and-personal-pronouns">Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns</h4>
<p>Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Course rosters may not list gender or pronouns, so you may be asked to indicate the pronouns you use so that the instructor does not make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (you are not obligated to do so). If you use a chosen name, please let the instructor know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in this course. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so we should encourage openness to correction and learning. Chosen names and personal pronouns may evolve, so if at any point during the semester you would like to be addressed differently, please let the instructor know.</p>

<p>The University of Kentucky Code of Student Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress.</p>
<p>Meetings of this course might be recorded by the instructor. All video and audio recordings of lectures, lab demonstrations, and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this program only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and cannot be copied, shared, or redistributed.</p>
<p>As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.</p>
<p>If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent before such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.</p>
<p>Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the online meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.</p>

<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-plagiarism">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Plagiarism</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.1)</p>
<p>Please note that any textual content that you add to the map should be in your own words or <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html">properly cited</a> if you are using someone else&rsquo;s words or content (see the section on plagiarism).</p>
<p>Per University policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the University, may be imposed.</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty, as explained in the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities . Complete information can be found on the Academic Ombud page. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.</p>
<p>Senate Rule 6.3.1 (see current Senate Rules ) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about a question of plagiarism involving their work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.</p>
<p>When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording, or content from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else&rsquo;s work (including, but not limited to, a published article, a book, a website, computer code, or a paper from a friend) without clear attribution. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be, except under specific circumstances (e.g., Writing Center review or peer review) allowed by the Instructor of Record or that person’s designee. Plagiarism may also include double submission, self-plagiarism, or unauthorized resubmission of one’s own work, as defined by the instructor.</p>
<p>Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, except where prohibited by the Instructor of Record (e.g., individual take-home exams). However, the actual work must be done by the student, and the student alone, unless collaboration is allowed by the Instructor of Record (e.g., group projects).</p>
<p>When a student&rsquo;s assignment involves research in outside sources or information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where, and how he/she has employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content, and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas, which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain.</p>
<p>Please note that any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-cheating">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Cheating</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.2)</p>
<p>Cheating is defined by its general usage. It includes, but is not limited to, the wrongfully giving, taking, or presenting any information or material by a student with the intent of aiding himself/herself or another on any academic work which is considered in any way in the determination of the final grade. The fact that a student could not have benefited from an action is not by itself proof that the action does not constitute cheating. Any question of definition shall be referred to the University Appeals Board.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-falsificationmisuse-of-academic-records">Academic Integrity–Prohibition on Falsification/Misuse of Academic Records</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.3)</p>
<p>Maintaining the integrity, accuracy, and appropriate privacy of student academic records is an essential administrative function of the University and the basic protection of all students. Accordingly, the actual or attempted falsification, theft, misrepresentation, or other alteration or misuse of any official academic record of the University, specifically including knowingly having unauthorized access to such records or the unauthorized disclosure of information contained in such records, is a serious academic offense. As used in this context, &ldquo;academic record&rdquo; includes all paper and electronic versions of the partial or complete permanent academic record, all official and unofficial academic transcripts, application documents and admission credentials, and all academic record transaction documents. The minimum sanction for falsification, including the omission of information, or attempted falsification, or other misuses of academic records as described in this section is suspension for one semester.</p>
