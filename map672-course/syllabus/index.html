<h3 id="lab--module-topics">Lab &amp; Module Topics</h3>
<h4 id="module-01-learning-foundations-of-the-technology-stack-html-css-and-js">Module 01: Learning Foundations of the Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, and JS</h4>
<p>This lesson will provide you with an introduction to the foundational technology stack used in web map development. We will introduce you to 3 separate coding technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), which work together to produce a web page and map application. The module suggests that web map design is achieved using these three technologies to structure content (HTML), and give form (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript) to this content. Design is then the convergence of content, form, and behavior.</p>
<p>Additionally, we&rsquo;ll practice writing these technologies within our powerful text editor, Brackets, as well as using in browser development tools to inspect the Document Object Module (DOM) and debug our code.</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the HTML document and Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
<li>structuring content with HTML</li>
<li>selecting and styling markup with CSS rules</li>
<li>adding behavior with JavaScript</li>
<li>using the in-browser development tools and JavaScript Console</li>
<li>developing within a local host server environment</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-02-the-building-blocks-of-programming-statements-expressions-data-types-operators-variables-and-array-data-structures">Module 02: The Building Blocks of Programming: Statements, Expressions, Data Types, Operators, Variables, and Array Data Structures</h4>
<p>In the previous module learned how to use HTML tags to structure our content within a webpage, and how to apply CSS style rules to modify the form of this content, or how that content looks (e.g., color, size, etc). These two elements, content and form, and the relationship between them, constitute two fundamental aspects of traditional design. Within the web environment we are able to introduce a third aspect to this classic understanding of design: that of behavior, which helps promote user interaction. In web mapping and web development in general today, the behavior of a web page or entities within it are controlled by the programming language JavaScript.</p>
<p>This module begins developing a foundation in computer programming using JavaScript. While we will quickly apply these practices to web mapping, you first need to gain an understanding of the basics of JavaScript, which can be largely applied to web development in general. If you already know a programming language, then you may find these easy to pick up, though you&rsquo;ll gain from learning the specific syntax with which we write JavaScript, as well as its nuances. If JavaScript is your first programming language, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that these programming fundamentals are not unique to JavaScript, but can be applied to the other programming languages as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>writing code: the atomic, building-block elements of JS programming:
<ul>
<li>statements</li>
<li>expressions</li>
<li>data types</li>
<li>operators</li>
<li>variables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>building and using an array data structure:
<ul>
<li>array construction</li>
<li>accessing array values</li>
<li>adding elements to arrays</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-03-javascript-control-structures">Module 03: JavaScript Control Structures</h4>
<p>In the previous module, when we ran our script within our web browser (such as by hitting page refresh), our JavaScript executed from the top of the script to the bottom. This is to say, the &ldquo;flow of program execution&rdquo; moved in one direction, from top to bottom. However, often we want to interrupt this flow of execution in various ways. This is where the idea of control structures come into play. Within this lesson, we&rsquo;ll learn how we control of flow of our JavaScript program.</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding program flow
<ul>
<li>looping in JS programming</li>
<li>for loops</li>
<li>while loops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conditional logic in JS programming (if/else statements)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-04-javascript-functions">Module 04: JavaScript Functions</h4>
<p>Often when we&rsquo;re programming, there are certain chucks of code (groups of JavaScript statements) that are all related and work together to accomplish specific functionality within the overall program. And often, we want to execute these at specific times, than once, or even repeatedly. Within this lesson, we&rsquo;ll learn how we make our programs more efficient through the use of functions. We&rsquo;ll first learn how we declare and define functions. Then we&rsquo;ll make functions more powerful by passing information to them and receiving information in return.</p>
<ul>
<li>mastering JavaScript functions:
<ul>
<li>declaring and calling custom functions</li>
<li>passing arguments and using function parameters</li>
<li>using return values</li>
<li>understanding function scope</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-05-javascript-objects-and-methods">Module 05: JavaScript Objects and Methods</h4>
<p>This lesson introduces you to another JavaScript data structure (a data type used for storing accessing, and updating various values): the JavaScript Object. You&rsquo;ll learn how to create these, populate them with key/value pairs, access these values, and update the object with new properties. We&rsquo;ll also learn how to loop through objects, as well as how objects make use of a special kind of function known as a method.</p>
<ul>
<li>using JavaScript objects:
<ul>
<li>creation of objects</li>
<li>accessing object properties</li>
<li>looping through a JavaScript object</li>
<li>using JavaScript methods (vs functions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-06-introduction-to-leaflet-and-drawing-svg">Module 06: Introduction to Leaflet and Drawing SVG</h4>
<p>This lesson will begin to get us acquainted with the Leaflet JavaScript mapping library. We&rsquo;ll learn how to read and understand the Leaflet API Reference documentation, which tells us how to access and use all the awesome Leaflet JavaScript functionality. We&rsquo;ll then work on creating a basic Leaflet map, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing initial options for how a map is displayed</li>
<li>modifying these options after a map has been created</li>
<li>providing a user with basic map interaction capabilities</li>
<li>adding and switching between different tile set layers using a Leaflet map</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, we&rsquo;ll want to learn how Leaflet employs Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to draw representations of geographic features on a map.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-07-using-geojson-data">Module 07: Using GeoJSON Data</h4>
<p>Within this lesson we sharpen our understanding of the GeoJSON specification and how data are encoded within it. We will use a useful web tool at <a href="http://geojson.io/">http://geojson.io/</a> to create and display GeoJSON data, and then we&rsquo;ll use this GeoJSON-encoded data within Leaflet to draw new data layers. To better understand how to use GeoJSON in Leaflet, we go into more depth exploring the Leaflet options and methods available to a Leaflet GeoJson layer.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s lab will offer you a guided tutorial on storing GeoJSON data in an external file, loading it into the script, and representing those data thematically with Leaflet.</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the GeoJSON specification and encoding data within it</li>
<li>using geojson.io to create and display GeoJSON data</li>
<li>using GeoJSON-encoded data within Leaflet to draw layers</li>
<li>exploring the Leaflet options and methods available to a Leaflet GeoJson layer</li>
<li>using external GeoJSON files in Leaflet</li>
<li>storing GeoJSON data in an external file and loading into the script</li>
<li>designing and developing a thematic proportional symbol map using Leaflet</li>
<li>retrieving specific data values from point symbols</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="module-08-mastering-leaflets-geojson-methods-and-layer-controls">Module 08: Mastering Leaflet&rsquo;s GeoJSON Methods and Layer Controls</h4>
<p>This lesson continues our study of creating and using the Leaflet L.GeoJson object. Beyond the powerful options available when we create layers using this method (pointToLayer, filter, oneEachFeature), we&rsquo;re going to invoke Leaflet methods on layer groups and individual layers after creation. We&rsquo;ll create additional layers in support of making a bi-variate promotional symbol map. We&rsquo;ll also learn how to use a Leaflet layer control to manage multiple data layers, and practice setting universal styles and layer-specific styles using the L.GeoJson style option. We&rsquo;ll finish up by introducing some advanced techniques for code refactoring.</p>
<ul>
<li>creating and using Leaflet L.GeoJson layers</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="extra-credit-thinking-about-map-673">Extra Credit: Thinking about MAP 673</h4>
<p>In MAP 673, you will be tasked to create a final project. In this extra credit opportunity, you will be asked to find data and make an interactive map using the skills learned in the previous modules from both MAP 671 &amp; 672.</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h4 id="covid-19-policy">COVID-19 Policy</h4>
<p>While this course is entirely online, students may find themselves on campus and should be aware of important changes. Please check <a href="https://www.uky.edu/coronavirus/">https://www.uky.edu/coronavirus/</a> for the most up-to-date information.</p>
<h3 id="academic-policies">Academic Policies</h3>
<p>This course adheres to the University of Kentucky&rsquo;s academic policies provided in the following link: <a href="https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/acadpolicy">https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/acadpolicy</a>. Additional policies are detailed in the below sections.</p>
<h4 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>This course does not require in-person nor synchronous online attendance.</p>
<h4 id="teamwork--collaboration">Teamwork &amp; Collaboration</h4>
<p>We are developing a workflow that enables very efficient remote collaboration. Many assignments have you make creative and aesthetic choices that have value in different contexts. Evaluation of your assignment will include suggested changes to and comments on your choices that might reflect different design requirements and sensibilities. Consider each week a collaboration with me, the instructor. If you want to explore a specific feature or technique, let me know.</p>
<p>If you collaborate on an assignment with fellow students, please observe the following expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should work through the lesson independently;</li>
<li>Please acknowledge your collaborators in your submission;</li>
<li>Submit your lab assignment to Canvas independently; and</li>
<li>Any textual content that you add to the map or web page, e.g., information about the area shown on the map, should be in your own words or properly cited if you are using someone else&rsquo;s words (see the section on plagiarism).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-of-assignments">Submission of Assignments</h4>
<p>The required course interactions are 1) submitting assignments and 2) various discussion board interactions. Students will be assigned weekly lessons, as found in the Canvas Modules section of this course. All work listed in these lessons must be submitted through Canvas by no later than 11:59 pm EDT on the day they are due (typically, the Sunday following the module&rsquo;s opening). Precise submission dates for each assignment can found in the Canvas Assignment section.</p>
<h4 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h4>
<p>Late assignments will be accepted. If you do not have an excused absence and you submit a late assignment, 10% will automatically will be deducted. Students with excused absences approved by the instructor will not be penalized. Late assignments submitted without an excused absence may not receive submission comments with the evaluation.</p>
<h4 id="excused-absences">Excused Absences</h4>
<p>Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant illness;</li>
<li>death of a family member;</li>
<li>trips for members of student organizations sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and trips * for participation in intercollegiate athletic events;</li>
<li>major religious holidays;</li>
<li>interviews for graduate/professional school or full-time employment post-graduation; and</li>
<li>other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for non-attendance” by the instructor of record. Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these policies, this course recognizes that a documented network or platform outage, e.g., Canvas not working, justifies an excused absence. Technical problems and scheduling conflicts also arise from time-to-time, and we recognize that assignments need to be turned in late. Please notify me as soon as possible if you anticipate a late assignment to discuss a “reasonable cause for non-attendance” and justify an excused absence.</p>
<h4 id="class-behavior-and-civility">Class Behavior and Civility</h4>
<p>All participants in this course should maintain the highest standards of academic, professional, and personal integrity and support a safe and inclusive learning environment (see the section on non-discrimination). With an understanding of mutual respect and civil discourse, we cultivate an online environment free from:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional harm, hostility, and excessive persuasion;</li>
<li>disturbances that interfere with course instruction and learning;</li>
<li>content that degrades an individual or group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructor reserves the right to stop and remove content (Zoom meetings, discussion posts, etc.) that conflicts with the above statement.</p>
<h4 id="chosen-names-and-personal-pronouns">Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns</h4>
<p>Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Course rosters may not list gender or pronouns, so you may be asked to indicate the pronouns you use so that the instructor does not make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (you are not obligated to do so). If you use a chosen name, please let the instructor know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in this course. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so we should encourage openness to correction and learning. Chosen names and personal pronouns may evolve, so if at any point during the semester you would like to be addressed differently, please let the instructor know.</p>
<h4 id="course-material-copyright-statement">Course Material Copyright Statement</h4>
<p>The University of Kentucky Code of Student Conduct defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress.</p>
<p>Meetings of this course might be recorded by the instructor. All video and audio recordings of lectures, lab demonstrations, and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this class only. They are available only through the Canvas shell for this course and cannot be copied, shared, or redistributed.</p>
<p>As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.</p>
<p>If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent before such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.</p>
<p>Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the class unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.</p>
<p>All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures, is the instructors&rsquo; intellectual property and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-plagiarism">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Plagiarism</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.1)</p>
<p>Please note that any textual content that you add to the map should be in your own words or <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html">properly cited</a> if you are using someone else&rsquo;s words or content (see the section on plagiarism).</p>
<p>Per University policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the University, may be imposed.</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty, as explained in the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities . Complete information can be found on the Academic Ombud page. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.</p>
<p>Senate Rule 6.3.1 (see current Senate Rules ) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about a question of plagiarism involving their work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.</p>
<p>When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording, or content from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else&rsquo;s work (including, but not limited to, a published article, a book, a website, computer code, or a paper from a friend) without clear attribution. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be, except under specific circumstances (e.g., Writing Center review or peer review) allowed by the Instructor of Record or that person’s designee. Plagiarism may also include double submission, self-plagiarism, or unauthorized resubmission of one’s own work, as defined by the instructor.</p>
<p>Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, except where prohibited by the Instructor of Record (e.g., individual take-home exams). However, the actual work must be done by the student, and the student alone, unless collaboration is allowed by the Instructor of Record (e.g., group projects).</p>
<p>When a student&rsquo;s assignment involves research in outside sources or information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where, and how he/she has employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content, and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas, which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain.</p>
<p>Please note that any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-cheating">Academic Integrity—Prohibition on Cheating</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.2)</p>
<p>Cheating is defined by its general usage. It includes, but is not limited to, the wrongfully giving, taking, or presenting any information or material by a student with the intent of aiding himself/herself or another on any academic work which is considered in any way in the determination of the final grade. The fact that a student could not have benefited from an action is not by itself proof that the action does not constitute cheating. Any question of definition shall be referred to the University Appeals Board.</p>
<h4 id="academic-integrityprohibition-on-falsificationmisuse-of-academic-records">Academic Integrity–Prohibition on Falsification/Misuse of Academic Records</h4>
<p>(Senate Rules 6.3.3)</p>
<p>Maintaining the integrity, accuracy, and appropriate privacy of student academic records is an essential administrative function of the University and the basic protection of all students. Accordingly, the actual or attempted falsification, theft, misrepresentation, or other alteration or misuse of any official academic record of the University, specifically including knowingly having unauthorized access to such records or the unauthorized disclosure of information contained in such records, is a serious academic offense. As used in this context, &ldquo;academic record&rdquo; includes all paper and electronic versions of the partial or complete permanent academic record, all official and unofficial academic transcripts, application documents and admission credentials, and all academic record transaction documents. The minimum sanction for falsification, including the omission of information, or attempted falsification, or other misuses of academic records as described in this section is suspension for one semester.</p>
<h4 id="statement-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei">Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)</h4>
<p>The University of Kentucky is committed to our core values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and human dignity, and a sense of community (Governing Regulations XIV).
