**Department of Geography**  
The University of Kentucky, College of Arts and Sciences  
January 14 – March 10, 2025  
Asynchronous online course

Section: 001 (3 credits)  
Instructor: Boyd Shearer  
Office: POT805A
Office Times: 1:30–2:30 pm Wednesdays & 2–4 pm Thursdays (and by appointment and on Zoom)

## Methods of Contact

### Office

Each Wednesday and Thursday during office hours, you may visit my office. Alternatively, you may choose to schedule a custom time meet online, which can provide more flexibility, e.g., after 5 PM. Find the link to Zoom in the **Canvas Zoom** section. You do not need to share your camera with the instructor, but be prepared to share your screen.

### Email

If students have questions about grades, accommodating missed assignments, or other personal issues, please contact the instructor via the **Canvas InBox**. <mark>Do not send messages to my @uky.edu email address without prior approval.</mark> Canvas InBox creates an easily accessible record of our correspondence. I will respond to messages within 24 hours.

## Course objective

This course will enable students to design and prepare a web mapping workflow for a project of their own selection. This project is the masterwork for the Master’s degree program in digital mapping. Students will determine a geographic problem mapping can address, identify user needs, review relevant literature, address ethical concerns, collect and prepare the data necessary for the project. Students will also propose strategies for data representation, user interface and online dissemination of the project. This course will culminate with a project design presentation and critique by peers and instructors.

## Course objectives and learning goals

MAP 698 is the first of a two-part sequence of courses aiming to produce a high-quality web map project in support of an MS thesis defense and degree. Within the course, your instructor and class team members will assist you in achieving the following objectives:

- **Identification** and clarification of an interesting and relevant project topic
- **Articulation** of anticipated user groups and UX design goals
- **Identification**, collection, transformation, analysis, and refinement of data
- A **written proposal** of final map project, including:
  - a literature review
  - anticipated personas and scenarios
  - wireframe/mockups
  - anticipated technology stack
  - description of wider socio-political concerns
  - plan for next steps moving forward in MAP 699

## Course strategy and format

Consider this course a loosely-structured &mdash; but not entirely open-ended &mdash; independent study. The course comprises five, 2-week components to help structure and push the progress of a final project forward. These benchmarks are intended to guide and ensure success that by the end of the course students have achieved:

- A clear **topic and plan** for the map project
- A **working dataset/database** for initial loading into a web-based map and data visualization interface
- A clearly written and refined **project proposal** clarifying the goals, intended user experience, and the design and development strategy.

MAP698 is like an independent study course; however, it's a course with structure, benchmarks, and the support of not only your instructor but your fellow classmates. While we want to leave the responsibility of the final project in your capable hands and not require too much interference, the course provides a few requirements for:

1. Understanding what your NMP course peers are up to, and
2. Offering your peers some useful insight and feedback

Therefore, throughout the course, you are required to engage with your class to offer feedback and insight. To that end, the general plan for the course is as follows:

## Course schedule

| Weeks       | Assignment                 | Deliverable                  | Due Date |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| 1 &ndash; 2 | Topic and data exploration | Ideas & datasets             | Feb 05   |
| 3 &ndash; 4 | Personal topic decision    | Strategy & literature review | Feb 19   |
| 5 &ndash; 6 | Data cultivation           | Wrangling & analysis         | March 04 |
| 7 &ndash; 8 | Proposal and refinement    | Project proposal             | March 10 |

Additional details and information will accompany each two-week assignment.

## Grading and evaluation

Your grade for this course will be based upon the following deliverables:

- Ideas & datasets (10%)
- Strategy & literature review (20%)
- Wrangling & analysis (20%)
- **Project proposal** and feedback to peers (50%)

## Course Policies

Enrolling in this course means that you agree to abide by these policies. Please read them carefully and refer to them throughout the semester.

### Academic Policies

This course adheres to the University of Kentucky's core academic policies:

- [Standard Academic Policy Statements](https://universitysenate.uky.edu/standard-academic-policy-statements)
- [Academic Offenses](https://universitysenate.uky.edu/academic-offenses-rules-undergraduate-and-graduate-students)

Additional and amended policies are detailed in the below sections.

#### Attendance Policy

This course does not require in-person nor synchronous online attendance.

#### Teamwork & Collaboration

Collaboration on data wrangling and cultivation is allowed. If you collaborate, please observe the following expectations:

- Please acknowledge your collaborators in your submission.
- Submit your lab assignment to Canvas independently.
- Any textual content that you add to the map or web page, e.g., information about the area shown on the map, should be in your own words or properly cited if you are using someone else's words (see the section on plagiarism).

#### Submission of Assignments

All assignments must be submitted through Canvas by no later than 11:59 pm EDT on the day they are due (typically, Sunday, except for the final project and quizzes). Precise submission dates for each assignment can found in Canvas.

#### Late Assignments

Your instructor is willing to accommodate late submissions, which may take the following forms:

- **Planning ahead**: If you anticipate travel or other events that may disrupt your ability to complete assignments on time, let your instructor know. When available you may be able to access modules and assignments ahead of time.
- **Extensions**: If you find yourself scrambling to complete an assignment by the due date, it's better to email your instructor ahead of time and ask for an extension. Good reasons are preferred.
- **Incomplete grades**: The last recourse for falling behind on assignments (with valid reasons, not excuses) is to take an incomplete grade and finish the material later on, either independently asynchronously or by jumping on with a subsequent term and finishing the assignments in sync with the class. Note that this is extra work for your instructor. Incomplete grades are subject to a [strict UK policy](https://ombud.uky.edu/requesting-incomplete-0).

All this being said, your best course of action is to maintain communication with your instructor throughout the course.

#### Excused Absences

Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences:

- significant illness;
- death of a family member;
- trips for members of student organizations sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and trips for participation in intercollegiate athletic events;
- major religious holidays;
- interviews for graduate/professional school or full-time employment post-graduation; and
- other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for non-attendance” by the instructor of record. Students should notify the professor of absences prior to class when possible.

In addition to these policies, this course recognizes that a documented network or platform outage can justify an excused absence. Technical problems and scheduling conflicts also arise from time-to-time, and we recognize that assignments need to be turned in late. Please notify me as soon as possible if you anticipate a late assignment to discuss a “reasonable cause for non-attendance” that justifies an excused absence.

#### Policy on Generative AI

GenAI tools such as ChatGPT may be used in this course for the purposes of brainstorming, testing, debugging, and discovering code. However, you are responsible for submitting work that meets the assignment standards for quality and factual accuracy.

Before submitting any assignment that was aided by GenAI, you are responsible for fact-checking all statements and ensuring that any content drawn from other sources – including the use of GenAI – is appropriately acknowledged through the citation practices used in this course.

For example, if you use ChatGPT to code part of a submission, you should cite: _Text generated by (or adapted from) ChatGPT, March 1, 2024, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com._ as a code comment near the code that was generated. Because you will likely modify the generated code to meet your goals, add additional comments that highlight the changes you made to the code.

By keeping track of your AI use and sharing your experiences, we all gain understanding, identify potential issues in this rapidly changing field, and discover better ways to use the resources for our objectives.

#### Class Behavior and Civility

All participants in this course should maintain the highest standards of academic, professional, and personal integrity and support a safe and inclusive learning environment (see the section on non-discrimination). With an understanding of mutual respect and civil discourse, we cultivate an online environment free from:

- emotional harm, hostility, and excessive persuasion;
- disturbances that interfere with course instruction and learning;
- content that degrades an individual or group.

The instructor reserves the right to stop and remove content that conflicts with the above statement.

#### Chosen Names and Personal Pronouns

Everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Course rosters may not list gender or pronouns, so you may be asked to indicate the pronouns you use so that the instructor does not make assumptions based on your name and/or appearance/self-presentation (you are not obligated to do so). If you use a chosen name, please let the instructor know. Chosen names and pronouns are to be respected at all times in this course. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen, so we should encourage openness to correction and learning. Chosen names and personal pronouns may evolve, so if at any point during the semester you would like to be addressed differently, please let the instructor know.

#### Course Material Copyright Statement

The [University of Kentucky Code of Student Conduct](https://regs.uky.edu/administrative-regulation/ar-410) defines Invasion of Privacy as using electronic or other devices to make a photographic, audio, or video record of any person without their prior knowledge or consent when such a recording is likely to cause injury or distress.

Meetings of this course might be recorded by the instructor. All video and audio recordings of lectures, lab demonstrations, and class meetings, provided by the instructors, are for educational use by students in this program only.

As addressed in the Student Code of Conduct, students are expected to follow appropriate university policies and maintain the security of linkblue accounts used to access recorded class materials. Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not enrolled in the class, or uploaded to other online environments.

If the instructor or a University of Kentucky office plans any other uses for the recordings, beyond this class, students identifiable in the recordings will be notified to request consent before such use. In anticipation of such cases, students may be asked to complete an “authorization of use” form by a faculty member.

Video and audio recordings by students are not permitted during the online meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructor. Any sharing, distribution, and or uploading of these recordings outside of the parameters of the class is prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor.

All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures, is the instructors' intellectual property and cannot be reproduced or sold without prior permission from the instructors. A student may use the material for reasonable educational and professional purposes extending beyond this class, such as studying for a comprehensive or qualifying examination in a degree program, preparing for a professional or certification examination, or to assist in fulfilling responsibilities at a job or internship.

#### Prohibition on Cheating and Plagiarism

Please note that any content that you add to your submission should be in your own words or [properly cited](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) if you are using someone else's words or content. See the University's policies on [Academic Offenses](https://universitysenate.uky.edu/academic-offenses-rules-undergraduate-and-graduate-students).

Students may also contact a faculty member within the department, program director, the director of undergraduate or graduate studies, the department chair, any college administrator, or the dean. All of these individuals are mandatory reporters under University policies.
